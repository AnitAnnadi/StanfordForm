  "FRQ_info_3": "You can see a breakdown of your students responses on the metrics page. Here you can see how many students selected each answer choice for each question. You will also be able to differentiate between the responses for each of the periods you teach, schools you teach at, and the different types of forms your students filled out.",
  "FRQ_info_5": "Yes, all student responses are fully anonymous. You will not be able to relate a student response to an actual student in your class. As a teacher, you will only be able to see the number of your students that selected a specific answer choice for each question.",
